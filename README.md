Bar me!

The program must contain data on at least 10 popular restaurants in Vratsa - name, geographical location, working hours.
•	When starting the program, the user must enter his current location(latitude and longitude). Then a menu with three options appears.
•	The first option is a LIST OF ALL. If the user selects it, a list of bars sorted from closest to farthest from the user appears on the screen. Each line of the list contains a serial number, bar name and working hours.
•	The second option is an OPEN LIST. Only the bars that are currently open appear on the screen. At the top are the ones that close soon. Each line of the list contains a serial number, the name of the bar and opening hours.
•	The third option is the MAP. The map of ASCII symbols appears on the screen. The location of the user is marked with X and he is always in the middle of the map, with the numbers from 1 to the number of bars the bars are marked. Below the map is a list showing which number corresponds to which bar. Each symbol on the map corresponds to 50 meters from the real world.
•	The program works with pre-entered data about the restaurants in the arrays.
